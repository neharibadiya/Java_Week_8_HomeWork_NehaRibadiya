/**
 * Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int.
 * Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not
 * within the range, the method should return false.
 * The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23;
 * otherwise, the method should return false.
 * EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
 * * hasSharedDigit(12, 23); → should return true since the digit 2 appears in both numbers
 * * hasSharedDigit(9, 99); → should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-99
 * * hasSharedDigit(15, 55); → should return true since the digit 5 appears in both numbers
 * NOTE: The method hasSharedDigit should be defined as public static
